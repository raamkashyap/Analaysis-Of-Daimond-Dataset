# Analysis-Of-Diamond-Dataset

Analysed Diamond Dataset taken from the openML repository as a part of Application Project in Statistical Data Mining Course.


                                                ABSTRACT

The history of the diamond industry from a political and social perspective is fascinating. Because each diamond is distinctive in its own way, it is crucial to understand diamonds. Without considering the peculiarities of the diamonds, even an expert cannot incorporate as much price information as a picture of the entire market. In order to understand the diamond market trends, quality, and price by analysing aspects for market research, we analyse the dataset of diamond obtained from openML repository with approximately 54000 samples. We have clearly performed an exploratory data analysis namely pairwise association, correlation association, PCA on the entire dataset to contemplate how different parameters have their impact on the price variable. Finally, we apply different regression algorithms Linear Regression and penalised regression models like ridge and lasso, Regression Trees and Random Forest to predict the price of a specific set of unseen diamond features. For Stability Estimation we have used Bootstrap.
